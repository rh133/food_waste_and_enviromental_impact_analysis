# food_waste_and_enviromental_impact_analysis
This project explores the sources of food waste and the impact each has on the environment through CO₂ emissions. It also investigates whether food waste levels correlate with a country’s financial status, measured by GDP per capita.

### Project Introduction 
A few weeks ago i saw a post that said if we want to reduce CO2 emission produced by food waste, we should "start in our own kitchens", which i found really interesting and worth pondering, and it got me wondering, is the amount of food waste we produce in our own homes actually more than that of all of these fast food restaurants and all the grocery stores ? and if so, does the amount of food wasted vary or have any type of relationship or correlation to the financial status of the country? this inspired me to look at this issue through a data-driven lense, and start this project to fact check this claim and learn more about this issue!

So this project dives into the breakdown of sources of food waste, explores and analyzes per capita waste by waste source (household, retail, food service) and GDP per capita, and the carbon emissions estimates from those waste levels, as well as investigates whether higher national income correlates with greater or lesser food waste, so by the end of this project the results and findings will be able to answer these questions:

### Key Questions
--1. Which sector is the biggest global contributor to food waste?
--2. Are high-income countries wasting more per capita?
--3. If households are actually the biggest contributor to house waste, how does it compare to other sectors and how does the CO2 emission produced vary?
